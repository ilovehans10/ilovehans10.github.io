	<h1>Camp 3</h1>
	<p>Altitude: 22,300 ft.<img src="Camp 3.jpg" align="right" style="margin-left: 20px;">
	</br>This is the camp at which on the way up all of the expeditions had a meeting and talked about what the order of them ascending was going to be. This is also the camp at which the IMAX group stayed at for a long time after their summit visit. This is very lucky the people in the other expeditions who were running low on oxygen because the IMAX group had a lot extra.</p>
