	<h1>Camp 4 (South Col)</h1>
	<p>Altitude: 25,900 ft.<img src="Camp 4.jpg" align="right" style="margin-left: 20px;">
	</br>Camp Four also known as the South Col is the last camp before the summit but expeditions will quite often go beyond this location and make a small camp further up the mountain. This, however, is where the more permanent camp was where our characters spent most of their time. This is the camp where the clients of the expedition tried to reach after they made the summit. There were 4 people that died near here after they weren't able to find the camp because of a blizzard. There was also one person who was stuck in the blizzard and after a night in the snow and with severe frostbite walked back into this camp nearly dead.</p>
