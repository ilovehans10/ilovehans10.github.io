	</br>This is the second place that they made camp and soon after this, the first death happened. One of Rob Halls close friends is climbing up on another expedition as a guide and has severe internal hemorrhaging in his brain causing loss of consciousness and then death. This death of someone close causes for Rob to be kind of out of it for a short while causing for Andy Harris to take over for him</p>
